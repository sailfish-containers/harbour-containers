_A Linux containers (LXC) manager for SailfishOS_

toc::[]

=== Documentation

==== What is it?
`harbour-containers` is a SailfishOS application to create, download, manage and run LXC containers. It relies on `Xwayland` to run the associated desktop environment inside a new Sailifsh window:

This makes it possible to run almost any Linux desktop application, as long as there is a version compiled for your architecture. See for instance `rofi` and `Darktable` below:

While LXC containers of desktop Linux distributions are most convenient with a hardware keyboard, `Onboard` is also preinstalled for compatibility with smartphone with no hardware keyboard:
